# Working with Word and PowerPoint

## From Equarius to Word / PowerPoint

* If you **copy a formula normally in Equarius** and **paste it into Word or PowerPoint**,
  it will be pasted as an **Office equation object**.

* If you want to paste the formula as **plain text (LaTeX)**:

  * **In Word**: paste using **Cmd + Shift + V**
  * **In PowerPoint**: paste using **Cmd + Shift + Option + V**

## From Word to Equarius

1. Click on the **equation object** in Word.
2. A tab called **“Equation”** will appear in the top ribbon. Open this tab.
3. Near the left side of the tab, find the option **“Unicode / LaTeX / Text”**.
4. Select **LaTeX**.
5. After this:

   * Select the entire equation object.
   * Copy it normally.
   * Paste it normally into **Equarius**.

**Note**:
Word remembers this setting. Once you select **LaTeX**, you do **not** need to change it again when copying other equations or equations from other documents.

## From PowerPoint to Equarius

* Copy the **equation object itself** in PowerPoint.
* Paste it directly into **Equarius**.

**Important**:
In PowerPoint, equations are placed inside a **text box**.
Do **not** copy the text box. Make sure to copy **only the equation object**, otherwise pasting will not work correctly.
